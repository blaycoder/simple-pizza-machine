# simple-pizza-machine
This is a simple pizza machine created with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I created this project to have better understanding on setTimeout, setInterval and DOM.
It was fun creating the project. I started by breaking the problem into pieces to enable me know what to do at each stage. At the end, I did a refactoring but I believe some areas still need refactoring.
