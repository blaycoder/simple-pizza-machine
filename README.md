# simple-pizza-machine
## This is a simple pizza machine created with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I created this project to help me understand how setTimeout, setInterval and DOM.
## It was fun creating the project. I started by breaking the problem into pieces to enable know what to do at each stage. 
## At the end, I did a refactoring but I believe some areas still need  to be refactor.
